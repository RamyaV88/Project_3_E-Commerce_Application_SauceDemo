Selenium WebDriver, Pytest, Data Driven Testing Framework, Hybrid Testing Framework, Page Object Model, OOPS Concepts, BaseTest, Assertions, Validations, Openpyxl, Conditional looping statements, Sorting functionality, 
Selecting random products dynamically, Conftest file with fixtures maintained for Setup and teardown functionality, Capturing Screenshots for validation, etc are deployed.

Logging of results and HTML report generation for each test case execution is taken care of.
